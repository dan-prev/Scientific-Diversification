# Scientific-Diversification

The Maximum Diversification strategy aims to create a portfolio with the highest possible diversification index, targeting long-term, sustainable returns by incorporating ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) constraints. Unlike traditional risk-return frameworks, this approach embraces a risk-return-impact perspective, making it especially appealing to ethical and impact-driven investors. Using the Dow Jones Industrial Average as a benchmark, the strategy significantly reduces sector concentration, with its highest exposure in IT at just 19.69%, and effectively invests in 24 out of 30 index components.

By integrating ESG criteria—specifically the Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating—the strategy filters out companies with poor sustainability profiles, excluding 3M, Boeing, Caterpillar, and Chevron. This ensures only companies meeting specific ethical thresholds are included. The portfolio achieves a high diversification index (174.27%) and the lowest annualized volatility (12.78%) among benchmark variations, making it particularly suitable for pension funds and risk-averse investors. Despite slightly lower returns than some alternatives, its Sharpe ratio (1.53) and tracking error metrics indicate a superior balance between risk and reward.

The strategy is further validated through Monte Carlo scenario analysis, assessing performance under optimistic, neutral, and pessimistic macroeconomic conditions. Even in the pessimistic case, the portfolio remains resilient due to its diversified structure and ESG-conscious filtering. The optimistic case forecasts a potential return of 22.7%, while the neutral scenario aligns closely with historical performance at 20.9%.

Performance comparisons reveal that while Max Diversification does not deliver the highest raw returns, it offers the best combination of volatility, sector concentration, ESG compliance, and drawdown protection. With a final return of $1.21 per $1 invested (Sept 2020–Aug 2021), it slightly underperforms the equally- and price-weighted versions but outshines the cap-weighted benchmark in risk-adjusted terms. Overall, the Max Diversification strategy, enhanced by ESG filters, represents a robust and future-oriented portfolio model grounded in Modern Portfolio Theory and suitable for institutional and impact-focused investors alike.
